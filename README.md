# BallEater

BallEater is a small arcade-style Android game written in Java. You control a red ball that must eat green food to stay alive. If the ball shrinks too much or collides with hostile food, the game ends. The project also contains an additional endless mode where food briefly appears at the screen edge before chasing the player.

## Building

This project uses Gradle. To build the debug APK run:

```sh
./gradlew assembleDebug
```

## Running

Install the generated APK on any device or emulator running **Android API 28** or higher. The main screen lets you start the classic "BallEater" mode or the "Food Escape" mode.
